# [1480. Running Sum of 1d Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/running-sum-of-1d-array/description/)

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
1st thought: Make tmp variable, and accumulate sum using it.
2nd thought: Regarding result variable - I can just add `nums[idx] + result[idx-1]`.

# Approach
1) Create len(n) array.
2) Initialize first element with nums[0].
3) With for loop, do `nums[idx] + result[idx-1]`.

<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->

# Complexity
- Time complexity: **O(n)** = Single for loop
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity: **O(1)** (the space occupied by the output array is not considered)
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```
class Solution(object):
    def runningSum(self, nums):
        result = [0 for i in range(len(nums))]
        result[0] = nums[0]
        for idx in range(1, len(nums)):
            result[idx] += nums[idx] + result[idx-1]
        return result

        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
```

# Better Solution

Following solution has same approach, but it uses given `nums` array instead of creating new len(n) array. 

By reusing `nums`, there's no need to initialize first element, hence better space complexity + simpler code!

```
class Solution(object):
    def runningSum(self, nums):
        i=1
        while(i<len(nums)):
            nums[i]=nums[i]+nums[i-1]
            i+=1
        return nums
```

# ⭐️ Lesson Learned

*  I tend to prefer `for loop` over `while loop`. Consider using `while loop`.
* Consider reusing given parameter as variable. (**Using Input Array for Output**) There might be no need to initialize new variable.
